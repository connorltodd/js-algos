// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str) {
  //You got this!
}

console.log(removeChar("place")); // should return "lac"
console.log(removeChar("person")); // should return "erso"
console.log(removeChar("country")); // should return "ountr"
console.log(removeChar("eloquent")); // should return "loquen"
